# Turn-Based-Strategy-Game
This is a Turn-Based Stategy Game which contains 4 player characters and 4 enemy characters in the starting area with 2 added in each area after the previous area is cleared.
There are ***4*** rooms in this game and every room has ***2*** enemy characters that unlocks once the previous room is cleared.

**An Infiltration is going on and the _4 fighters_ are entring the base area and now the job of the player is to clear all the remaining rooms by killing all the enemies in the rooms _one-by-one_.**

## User Interface

The game scene starts with 4 player characters and 2 enemies in front. There is a red bar on top of the character, that is the **Health Bar**. There are numbers depicted with the bar that are called **Turns** that dipicts the number of turns left for a specific fighter. The maximum numbers of turn given to a single fighter is 3, Therefore the total number of turns you get are 12. There are *6* options given below namely **move, spin, shoot, grenade, sword, interact** with each performing their specific functions as:-

1. The `move` helps you to move your character to the block you select. It takes one Turns.
2. The `spin` spins the character at it's axis. It takes one Turns.
3. The `shoot` makes player fire the gun at the enemy. It takes one Turns.
4. The `grenade` throws a grenade at the enemy and deals damege at splash. It takes one Turns.
5. The `sword` works on close range and kills enemy in one short. It takes one Turns.
6. The `interact` interacts with any object fallen on the ground. It takes one Turns.

Then there is an **END TURN** option on the top-right corner which is used if you don't want to use your turns or all of your turns are used.

## In This Game
We use our **Left-Click** to help the character move to the block that we click upon. The **W,A,S,D** keys are used to move the camera in the game. The player can decide either *to shoot*, *to throw a grenade*, or *to use the sword*.
+ The sword kills in [one-shot](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/one-shot#:~:text=(video%20games)%20To%20kill%20or%20destroy%20with%20a%20single%20hit.) but needs the character to be at the close blocks with the enemy.
+ The grenade deals [splash damage](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/splash_damage#:~:text=Noun,creatures%20within%20a%20certain%20radius.) but the damege delt to a single enemy is minimum.
+ The gun has a long-range and can deal a good amount of damage.
